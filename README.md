# Zeka VS Code (zeka-vs-code)

Zeka is my custom [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de)-inspired,
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)-based knowledge
management system. Zeka is designed to not depend on any specific tools, but I
hope this extension will make my life much easier.

I am actually designing Zeka as I write this extension. Someday I might describe
Zeka here in case anyone wishes to adopt it also.
