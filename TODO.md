# Zeka TODO

* In a new note: add dummy @tag and "- - - - -"
* *Add Attachment* command (for images, basically).
* Show link information (title, reference info) in the status bar or something
  like that.
* Render links to notes.
* Render links to references.
* Render links to attachments.
* *Link Attachment* command (including some decent searching, maybe browse
  looking at the images themselves).
* When adding reference, split a title like "Foo: Bar" into title and subtitle,
  and pre-fill the template accordingly.
* Rename file when title is changed.
* Auto-complete #tags (well, not using #tags at the moment, only @tags).
* Auto-complete @topics.
* Promote sketch to note.

* Generation of book titles is subpar (handing of the edition is particularly
  half-backed).
* Improve performance of "Create Link" (currently reads all notes and references
  every time the command is invoked -- will not scale to larger repositories).
